# ezLuaEngine

WIP web game engine using emscripten and LUA

https://noahnoah55.github.io/ezLuaEngine/

## Building

Currently only building for Linux, Windows builds coming next time I work on this at my PC

First load emsdk with
```source configure```

Then
```make run```

The engine will attempt to read `main.lua` from the build folder, so put any behavior in that file.

Better instructions coming when the API is more fleshed out
