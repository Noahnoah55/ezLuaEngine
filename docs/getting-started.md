# Quickstart

To compile a game, type `source configure` followed by `make run` while in the base folder of the project. This will compile the engine and package all the files from the `game-files` folder into the game and open a browser to show the game in action.

The `build` folder will contain the compiled game, which can be freely rehosted.
